    <p><strong>What is a “distribution?"</strong></p>
<section id="definition">
<p>Linux has a number of different versions to suit nearly any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros.”) Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).</p>

    <p>The most popular Linux distributions are:</p>
<img src="https://www.linux.com/sites/all/themes/custom/lcom/images/lf/Unity-desktop.jpg" alt="" width ="400">    
    <p>Ubuntu\'s Unity desktop.</p>
    
    <p><ul><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank"> Ubuntu Linux</a></ul></p>

     <p><ul><a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank"> Linux Mint</a></ul></p>

    <p><ul><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank"> Arch Linux</a></ul></p>

     <p><ul><a href="www.linuxdeepin.com/index.en.html" target="_blank"> Deepin</a></ul></p>

     <p><ul><a href="https://getfedora.org/"> Fedora</a target="_blank"></ul></p>

     <p><ul><a href="https://www.debian.org/"> Debian</a target="_blank"></ul></p>

     <p><ul><a href="https://www.opensuse.org/en/" target="_blank"> openSUSE.</a></ul></p>

<p>Each distribution has a different take on the desktop. Some opt for very modern user interfaces (such as Ubuntu’s Unity, above, and Deepin’s Deepin Desktop), whereas others stick with a more traditional desktop environment (openSUSE uses KDE).

<p>You can check out the top 100 distributions on the <a href="https://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">Distrowatch site.</a></p>

<p>And don’t think the server has been left behind. For this arena, you can turn to:</p>

<ul><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en" target="_blank">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a></ul>

<ul><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server" target="_blank">Ubuntu Server</a></ul>

<ul><a href="https://www.centos.org/" target="_blank">CentOS</a></ul>

<ul><a href="https://www.suse.com/products/server/" target="_blank">SUSE Enterprise Linux.</a></ul>

<p>Some of the above server distributions are free (such as Ubuntu Server and CentOS) and some have an associated price (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Enterprise Linux). Those with an associated price also include support.</p>

<section id="choose-the-right-distribution">

<p><strong>Which distribution is right for you?</strong></p>

<p>Which distribution you use will depend upon the answer to three simple questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How skilled of a computer user are you?</li>

<li>Do you prefer a modern or a standard desktop interface?</li>

<li>Server or desktop?</li>
    
</ul>

<p>If your computer skills are fairly basic, you’ll want to stick with a newbie-friendly distribution such as Linux Mint, Ubuntu, or Deepin. If you’re skill set extends into the above-average range, you could go with a distribution like Debian or Fedora. If, however, you’ve pretty much mastered the craft of computer and system administration, use a distribution like <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/" target="_blank">Gentoo.</a></p>

<p>If you’re looking for a server-only distribution, you will also want to decide if you need a desktop interface, or if you want to do this via command-line only. The Ubuntu Server does not install a GUI interface. This means two things – your server won’t be bogged down loading graphics and you’ll need to have a solid understanding of the Linux command line. However (there is always an “however” with Linux), you can install a GUI package on top of the Ubuntu Server with a single command like sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop. System administrators will also want to view a distribution with regards to features. Do you want a server-specific distribution that will offer you, out of the box, everything you need for your server? If so, CentOS might be the best choice. Or, do you want to take a desktop distribution and add the pieces as you need them? If so, Debian or Ubuntu Linux might serve you well.</p>
